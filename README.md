# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems.

To run the solutions*:
1. Make sure that Elixir is installed properly.
2. Navigate to folder of that Day in your shell.
3. Run the code, E.g. `elixir Day7.exs`
4. Solution will spit out, E.g. `# of bags that eventually contain at least 1 shiny gold bag: *XXX*`

* This might change. My goal is to consolidate running the solutions to one file with an input or 2 like `aoc 7 2` (give solution for Day 7 Part 2.) This would also let me move all the .exs files to .ex files so I can add tests and clean up some code duplication.
